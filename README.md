Moving on from there, you will be taught how to prove the Pythagorean theorem and how to use it to find the missing sides of a triangle. This online electrical course explores the unique angles and their expression as both a function and simple ratios as well as trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent.																					
		· Electrical parameters and values are better understood using the concept of the unit circle, angles, sine, cosine and tangent values and you will be taught how to express the sine, cosine and tangents of special angles in simple ratios. Through the concept of the unit circle, you will then gain an understanding of why the trigonometric functions have a negative sign for some angles. Since there are many special angles, remembering them can be a great challenge. Have you ever wondered if there is a simple way to easily remember the values of these special angles? Well yes, there is! This certificate in electrical engineering provides you with a trigonometric table that would help you easily remember the values of special angles and trigonometric functions without having to use a calculator. The laws of sine and cosine will also be taught in order to calculate the missing sides or unknown sides of a triangle as well as missing angles.																					
		· As an electrical engineer, you are at one point in your career going to run into proofs of trigonometric equations. This electrical engineering online course is going to teach you how to prove basic trigonometric identities such as the sum formula, difference formula, product to sum and sum to product formulas. You will also learn about the reciprocal identities, quotient identities, negative angle identities and Pythagorean identities. The content also covers how to prove the double-angle and half-angle formulas and how to apply them to solve trigonometric problems and then concluding with how to use trigonometric tables to find the sine, cosine and tangent of angles between 0 and 90 degrees. Basic knowledge of intermediate mathematics such as equations and binomials is required to gain the most value out of this interesting course. You should enrol for this course if you are an electrical engineer, technologist or student of engineering and technology because the fundamental knowledge of trigonometry is widely applied in these and related fields and can open a new set of potential job opportunities

		It looks like you're keen on understanding the detailed formulations and applications of determinants and complex numbers—two critical areas in engineering mathematics. Let's explore deeper into their calculations:																					
		Module 1: Determinants																					
		1. Second-Order Determinants:																					
		o Formula: D=ad−bcD = ad - bc.																					
		o Example Calculation: If D=[63−23]D = \begin{bmatrix} 6 & 3 \\ -2 & 3 \end{bmatrix}, then:																					
																							
		D=(6⋅3)−(3⋅−2)=18+6=24.D = (6 \cdot 3) - (3 \cdot -2) = 18 + 6 = 24.																					
		2. Third-Order Determinants:																					
		o Formula: A bit more complex, involves expanding along a row or column. For:																					
																							
		D=[abcdefghi],D = \begin{bmatrix} a & b & c \\ d & e & f \\ g & h & i \end{bmatrix},																					
		the determinant is:																					
																							
		D=a(ei−fh)−b(di−fg)+c(dh−eg).D = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg).																					
		3. Cramer's Rule: Used for solving systems of linear equations using determinants:																					
																							
		x=DxD,y=DyD,z=DzD.x = \frac{D_x}{D}, \quad y = \frac{D_y}{D}, \quad z = \frac{D_z}{D}.																					
		Module 2: Complex Numbers																					
		1. Addition/Subtraction:																					
		o Example: (2+3i)+(4−i)=(2+4)+(3−1)i=6+2i(2 + 3i) + (4 - i) = (2+4) + (3-1)i = 6 + 2i.																					
		2. Multiplication:																					
		o Example: (2+3i)(4−i)=(2⋅4−3⋅−1)+(2⋅−1+3⋅4)i=11+10i(2 + 3i)(4 - i) = (2 \cdot 4 - 3 \cdot -1) + (2 \cdot -1 + 3 \cdot 4)i = 11 + 10i.																					
		3. Division:																					
		o Using conjugates, divide (3+2i)(3 + 2i) by (1−i)(1 - i): Multiply numerator and denominator by (1+i)(1 + i):																					
		\[ \frac{(3+2i)}{(1-i)} = \frac{(3+2i)(1+i)}{(1-i)(1+i)} = \frac{3+3i+2i+2i2}{1+12} = \frac{1+5i}{2}. \]																					
		4. Polar Form:																					
		o Convert z=3+4iz = 3 + 4i: Modulus: r=32+42=5r = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2} = 5. Argument: θ=tan⁡−1(43)≈53.1∘\theta = \tan^{-1}(\frac{4}{3}) \approx 53.1^\circ. Polar Form: z=5(cos⁡53.1∘+isin⁡53.1∘)z = 5(\cos 53.1^\circ + i\sin 53.1^\circ).

		Key Concepts of Differential Calculus																					
		1. Derivative:																					
		o A derivative measures how a function changes as its input changes. It's the central concept of Differential Calculus.																					
		o Example: In physics, if you have a function describing position over time, its derivative gives you the velocity (rate of change of position).																					
		2. Notation:																					
		o Derivatives are often written as f′(x)f'(x), dydx\frac{dy}{dx}, or Df(x)Df(x). These all represent the slope or rate of change at a given point.																					
		3. Applications:																					
		o Slope of a curve: Calculus lets us calculate slopes for curved lines at any point.																					
		o Optimization: It helps identify maximum or minimum values of a function—vital for engineering designs and efficiency calculations.																					
		o Motion Analysis: Engineers use derivatives to analyze acceleration, velocity, and forces acting on objects.																					
		4. Rules and Techniques: Differential Calculus involves formulas to simplify finding derivatives. For example:																					
		o Power Rule: If f(x)=xnf(x) = x^n, then f′(x)=nxn−1f'(x) = nx^{n-1}.																					
		o Product Rule: (uv)′=u′v+uv′(uv)' = u'v + uv', for functions u(x)u(x) and v(x)v(x).																					
		o Chain Rule: Used when functions are composed, i.e., g(f(x))′=g′(f(x))⋅f′(x)g(f(x))' = g'(f(x)) \cdot f'(x).																					
		Real-World Engineering Applications

		· Mathematics: If the car's position is given as s(t)=3t2+2t+5s(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 5, where tt represents time in seconds, the derivative s′(t)=6t+2s'(t) = 6t + 2 provides the velocity of the car. A second derivative s′′(t)=6s''(t) = 6 gives the car's acceleration.																					
		2. Electrical Engineering																					
		· Scenario: Studying alternating current (AC) in a circuit.																					
		· Mathematics: If voltage V(t)=50sin⁡(2πft)V(t) = 50\sin(2\pi ft), where ff is the frequency, then the derivative V′(t)=100πfcos⁡(2πft)V'(t) = 100\pi f\cos(2\pi ft) tells us the rate at which voltage changes over time—a crucial factor in designing circuits.																					
		3. Optimization in Design

		4. Economics																					
		· Scenario: Analyzing revenue growth.																					
		· Mathematics: If revenue is modeled as R(p)=100p−5p2R(p) = 100p - 5p^2, where pp is the price, the derivative R′(p)=100−10pR'(p) = 100 - 10p indicates how revenue changes with price adjustments.																					
		5. Climate Studies																					
		· Scenario: Tracking temperature changes over time.																					
		· Mathematics: If temperature variation is T(t)=30+5t−t2T(t) = 30 + 5t - t^2, the derivative T′(t)=5−2tT'(t) = 5 - 2t shows whether temperatures are rising or falling at a specific time.																					
		1. Basic Rules of Differentiation																					
		To start, apply these foundational rules:																					
		· Power Rule: If f(x)=xnf(x) = x^n, then f′(x)=n⋅xn−1f'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}. Example: f(x)=x3  ⟹  f′(x)=3x2f(x) = x^3 \implies f'(x) = 3x^2.																					
		· Constant Rule: If f(x)=cf(x) = c, where cc is constant, then f′(x)=0f'(x) = 0. Example: f(x)=5  ⟹  f′(x)=0f(x) = 5 \implies f'(x) = 0.																					
		· Sum/Difference Rule: If f(x)=g(x)+h(x)f(x) = g(x) + h(x), then f′(x)=g′(x)+h′(x)f'(x) = g'(x) + h'(x). Example: f(x)=x2+3x  ⟹  f′(x)=2x+3f(x) = x^2 + 3x \implies f'(x) = 2x + 3.																					
		2. Advanced Rules																					
		For more complex functions:																					
		· Product Rule: If f(x)=u(x)⋅v(x)f(x) = u(x) \cdot v(x), then f′(x)=u′(x)⋅v(x)+u(x)⋅v′(x)f'(x) = u'(x) \cdot v(x) + u(x) \cdot v'(x). Example: f(x)=x⋅sin⁡(x)  ⟹  f′(x)=1⋅sin⁡(x)+x⋅cos⁡(x)=sin⁡(x)+x⋅cos⁡(x)f(x) = x \cdot \sin(x) \implies f'(x) = 1 \cdot \sin(x) + x \cdot \cos(x) = \sin(x) + x \cdot \cos(x).																					
		· Quotient Rule: If f(x)=u(x)v(x)f(x) = \frac{u(x)}{v(x)}, then f′(x)=u′(x)⋅v(x)−u(x)⋅v′(x)v(x)2f'(x) = \frac{u'(x) \cdot v(x) - u(x) \cdot v'(x)}{v(x)^2}. Example: f(x)=x2ln⁡(x)  ⟹  f′(x)=2x⋅ln⁡(x)−x2⋅1xln⁡(x)2f(x) = \frac{x^2}{\ln(x)} \implies f'(x) = \frac{2x \cdot \ln(x) - x^2 \cdot \frac{1}{x}}{\ln(x)^2}.																					
		· Chain Rule: If f(x)=g(h(x))f(x) = g(h(x)), then f′(x)=g′(h(x))⋅h′(x)f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \cdot h'(x). Example: f(x)=sin⁡(x2)  ⟹  f′(x)=cos⁡(x2)⋅2xf(x) = \sin(x^2) \implies f'(x) = \cos(x^2) \cdot 2x.

		Definition:																					
		A function f(x)f(x) is continuous at x=ax = a if:																					
																							
		lim⁡x→a−f(x)=lim⁡x→a+f(x)=f(a).\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).																					
		Example:																					
		For f(x)=x2f(x) = x^2, check continuity at x=2x = 2:																					
		1. Evaluate the left-hand limit (x→2−x \to 2^-):																					
																							
		lim⁡x→2−f(x)=4.\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 4.																					
		2. Evaluate the right-hand limit (x→2+x \to 2^+):																					
																							
		lim⁡x→2+f(x)=4.\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = 4.																					
		3. Evaluate the function at x=2x = 2:																					
																							
		f(2)=4.f(2) = 4.																					
		Since all values match, f(x)f(x) is continuous at x=2x = 2.

		Lq=528(8−5)=2524≈1.04 jobs.L_q = \frac{5^2}{8(8-5)} = \frac{25}{24} \approx 1.04 \, \text{jobs}.

		where:

		Integrals and derivatives provide powerful tools for analyzing and solving problems within the frameworks of the Applied Management N6 syllabus. Here’s an advanced exploration, integrating calculus concepts and their applications to management scenarios:																					
		Calculus Applications in Key Modules																					
		1. Module 4: Productivity																					
		· Workflow Optimization Using Integrals:																					
		o To maximize efficiency, the total time or cost TT of a process can be modeled as:																					
																							
		T=∫abC(x) dx,T = \int_a^b C(x) \, dx,																					
		where C(x)C(x): cost or time at a given stage xx.																					
		Example: For a kitchen workflow with cost rate C(x)=5x2+3xC(x) = 5x^2 + 3x over the interval [1,3][1, 3]:																					
		1. Compute total cost:																					
		\[ T = \int_1^3 (5x^2 + 3x) \, dx = \left[\frac{5x^3}{3} + \frac{3x2}{2}\right]_13. \]																					
		2. Result:																					
																							
		T=(5⋅273+3⋅92)−(5⋅13+3⋅12)=45+13.5−1.67=56.83.T = \left(\frac{5 \cdot 27}{3} + \frac{3 \cdot 9}{2}\right) - \left(\frac{5 \cdot 1}{3} + \frac{3 \cdot 1}{2}\right) = 45 + 13.5 - 1.67 = 56.83.																					
		2. Module 5: Performance Management and Appraisal																					
		· Performance Metrics Using Derivatives:																					
		o Employee performance (PP) can be tracked as a function of time:																					
																							
		dPdt=rate of performance improvement.\frac{dP}{dt} = \text{rate of performance improvement}.																					
		Example: If performance follows P(t)=3t2+2tP(t) = 3t^2 + 2t, find the rate of improvement after t=5t = 5:																					
		1. Compute:																					
																							
		dPdt=6t+2.\frac{dP}{dt} = 6t + 2.																					
		2. At t=5t = 5:																					
																							
		dPdt=6⋅5+2=32.\frac{dP}{dt} = 6 \cdot 5 + 2 = 32.																					
		3. Module 6: Marketing Management																					
		· Revenue Modeling with Price Elasticity:																					
		o The total revenue R(p)R(p) based on price pp:																					
																							
		R(p)=p⋅D(p),R(p) = p \cdot D(p),																					
		where D(p)D(p): demand function.																					
		Example: If D(p)=100−5pD(p) = 100 - 5p, then:																					
		1. Revenue:																					
																							
		R(p)=p(100−5p)=100p−5p2.R(p) = p(100 - 5p) = 100p - 5p^2.																					
		2. Maximize revenue by finding dRdp=0\frac{dR}{dp} = 0:																					
																							
		dRdp=100−10p=0  ⟹  p=10.\frac{dR}{dp} = 100 - 10p = 0 \implies p = 10.																					
		4. Module 7: Control Systems and Technology																					
		· Budget Constraints Using Integrals:																					
		o To manage inventory and costs:																					
																							
		B=∫0Tc(t) dt,B = \int_0^T c(t) \, dt,																					
		where c(t)c(t): cost rate over time tt.																					
		Example: For c(t)=200−20tc(t) = 200 - 20t over [0,5][0, 5]:																					
		1. Compute:																					
		\[ B = \int_0^5 (200 - 20t) \, dt = \left[200t - 10t2\right]_05. \]																					
		2. Result:																					
																							
		B=(200⋅5−10⋅52)−0=1000−250=750.B = (200 \cdot 5 - 10 \cdot 5^2) - 0 = 1000 - 250 = 750.

		Ptotal=∫0TP(t) dt,P_{\text{total}} = \int_0^T P(t) \, dt,																					
		where P(t)P(t) is the power drawn over time tt.																					
		Example: For a panel supplying P(t)=100+20t WP(t) = 100 + 20t \, \text{W} from t=0 hrt = 0 \, \text{hr} to t=5 hrt = 5 \, \text{hr}:																					
		1. Compute:

		2. Result:

Here’s an advanced exploration integrating integrals, derivatives, and statistical methods for assessment processes:																					
		Advanced Calculations in Marksheet Preparation																					
		1. Calculating Semester Marks Using Weighted Averages																					
		The semester mark combines the theoretical and practical components:																					
																							
		Msem=wtT+wpPwt+wp,M_{\text{sem}} = \frac{w_t T + w_p P}{w_t + w_p},																					
		where:																					
		· TT: Theoretical component score,																					
		· PP: Practical component score,																					
		· wt,wpw_t, w_p: Weights for theoretical and practical marks.																					
		Example: If wt=0.6w_t = 0.6, wp=0.4w_p = 0.4, T=75T = 75, and P=85P = 85:																					
																							
		Msem=(0.6⋅75)+(0.4⋅85)0.6+0.4=45+341=79.M_{\text{sem}} = \frac{(0.6 \cdot 75) + (0.4 \cdot 85)}{0.6 + 0.4} = \frac{45 + 34}{1} = 79.																					
		2. Total Final Mark Calculation																					
		The final mark combines semester marks (SS) and examination marks (EE):																					
																							
		F=0.4S+0.6E.F = 0.4S + 0.6E.																					
		Example: If S=79S = 79 and E=82E = 82:

		μ=∑xiN,σ2=∑(xi−μ)2N.\mu = \frac{\sum x_i}{N}, \quad \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum (x_i - \mu)^2}{N}.																					
		Example: Grades: [75,80,85,70,90][75, 80, 85, 70, 90], N=5N = 5:																					
		1. Mean:																					
																							
		μ=75+80+85+70+905=80.\mu = \frac{75 + 80 + 85 + 70 + 90}{5} = 80.																					
		2. Variance:																					
																							
		σ2=(75−80)2+(80−80)2+(85−80)2+(70−80)2+(90−80)25=50.\sigma^2 = \frac{(75-80)^2 + (80-80)^2 + (85-80)^2 + (70-80)^2 + (90-80)^2}{5} = 50.																					
		3. Standard Deviation:

		Mc=∫0Tf(t) dt,M_c = \int_0^T f(t) \, dt,																					
		where f(t)f(t) represents marks obtained at time tt.																					
		Example: If f(t)=10+2tf(t) = 10 + 2t, compute McM_c over [0,5][0, 5]:																					
		\[ M_c = \int_0^5 (10 + 2t) \, dt = \left[10t + t2\right]_05 = (50 + 25) - 0 = 75. \]
